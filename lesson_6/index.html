				Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 â€“ 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker,
				ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential
				artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed
				sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and
				explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and the anti-war
				painting Guernica , a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces
				during the Spanish Civil War.Demoiselles d'Avignon and the anti-war

				Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner
				through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as
				he
				experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older
				artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry
				between
				the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.the two artists,
